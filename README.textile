h2. About

WikiBot was originally a PHP-based framework for bots I run on Wikipedia, however when it broke due to changes in mediawiki code, I decided to rewrite it in Ruby, using the MediaWiki API instead of screen-scraping. This is the result.

As you'll notice, the features it provides are rather sparse at the moment, as I've only been adding features that I require. When I get more time, I'll flesh it out more.

h2. Gem Requirements

* "taf2-curb":taf2 (a fork of curb; using the base curb gem might work but is untested)
* "xml-simple":xml
